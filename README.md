# FootPrint
For my final project in Intro to Web Technologies, I created a 3D shoe printing website using mock technology. This project allowed me to apply my front-end development skills, including search engine optimization, modern design, and best practices for website design. I am proud to have received a 100% grade on this coursework, which demonstrates my ability to effectively use web technologies to create engaging and user-friendly websites.
